# HC12-Flight-Controller

This is my working flight controller using two HC12 modules;
an onboard arduino is used to handle incoming communications from the hc12 and use them respectively.
A esp32 on the ground is used to handle bluetooth controller inputs and send the to the hc12.

Safety measures are put in place.
Some features are WIP but the base of the flight controller works.
